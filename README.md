# Etch A Sketch
Coding Etch A Sketch in Python

As I'm seriously getting into Python, I thought it would be nice to create something out of the blue. I came up with this Etch A Sketch idea. It's rather easy to develop a first MVP.

I created the initial code within a notebook on Google Colaboratory but I wanted to share the code of the notebook with the GitHub community. I didn't search for similar work but I'm pretty sure this isn't the first Etch A Sketch in Python

Anyway, if you come across this work and wants to draw something, don't hesitate to share your art with me : [@charlaporte](http://www.twitter.com/charlaporte)
